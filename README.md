# CNN-Classifier-vs-using-B-Float

Developed and deployed a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier and an additional CNN model using bfloat-16 data. Incorporated SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and SMOTE-ENN (SMOTE with Edited Nearest Neighbors) algorithms to address class imbalances, meticulously assessing accuracy and performance. Conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of results and computational efficiency.
